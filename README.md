# Micro Java Language Lexical Analyzer

This repository contains the code for a Lexical Analyzer designed specifically for the Micro Java language. The Lexical Analyzer parses input code written in Micro Java and generates tokens as output, which are then stored in an output file.

## Instructions

To execute the code:

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
   
2. **Open** the `code.txt` file and paste the Micro Java code you want to analyze.

3. **Run** the main file (provide instructions on how to run the main file here, e.g., using a specific command or IDE).

4. The output of the Lexical Analyzer will be stored in the `output.txt` file within the repository.

## Usage

The Lexical Analyzer is designed to process Micro Java code and identify tokens including keywords, identifiers, operators, symbols, and literals, among others. It performs lexical analysis to break down the code into tokens for further processing.

## Example

For example, consider the following Micro Java code:

```java
// Sample Micro Java code
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
